== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Solid Central free? =

You can [signup today](https://go.solidwp.com/central-30-day-trial), test it out, and if you are unsatisfied reach out to our team to ask about our 30-day refund policy. Our plans start with the ability to manage 5 sites for $6.99/month. If you need additional sites, you can.

= Do you offer support? =

Yes. We handle support for Solid Central users both from the WordPress.org forum and from the SolidWP Help Desk. The SolidWP Help Desk offers private, ticketed support to protect your privacy.

= Is Solid Central secure? =

Yes. Solid Central uses industry-standard SSL technology to encrypt all communication between your Central dashboard and the client sites you connect to it. Only Central account holders and the users they add can access the Central dashboard once they log in. You can require two-factor authentication to be used to access the Central dashboard.

= Does Solid Central work with WordPress.com sites? =

WordPress.com offers free website and paid website. Free websites on WordPress.com do not have the ability to install plugins. Paid WordPress.com plans do. Solid Central requires the use of this free plugin and therefore Solid Central only works on paid WordPress.com websites, not free ones.

= Help! I‚Äôm having problems adding a site to Sync. =

Solid Central includes an automatic ‚ÄúAdd Site‚Äù prompt when you first login to the Central dashboard. If this authentication method fails, try manually installing the Solid Central plugin on your WordPress site.

If you still need help, please open a ticket at the [Solid Help Desk](help.solidwp.com).
